INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The instructions are basically as per any Perl distribution.


INSTALLING AUTOMATICALLY
------------------------

The easiest way to install is via CPAN, CPANPLUS or cpanminus:

CPAN:

    % perl -MCPAN -e shell                    [as root]
    > install Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey
    > quit

CPANPLUS:

    % cpanp
    > i Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey
    > q

cpanminus:

    % cpanm Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey

See your local documentation ('perldoc CPAN', 'perldoc CPANPLUS' or 
'perldoc cpanm') for further instructions on setting up and configuring your
chosen installer.


OBTAINING THE MODULE
--------------------

The latest release version of Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey can be 
downloaded from any CPAN site:

    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/B/BA/BARBIE/
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey/

The release is distributed as a gzipped tar archive file:

    Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey-<version>.tar.gz

where <version> represents the current version number, e.g. 0.01.

To install the module, unpack the distribution archive to
create an installation directory. Something like this:

    tar zxf Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey-0.01.tar.gz

or

    gunzip Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey-0.01.tar.gz
    tar xf Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey-0.01.tar

You can then 'cd' into the directory created,

    cd Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey-0.01


INSTALLING MANUALLY
-------------------

The 'make install' (done later) will install the modules and scripts on
your system. You may need administrator privileges to perform this task.
Alternately you can install the module to a local directory (see
ExtUtils::MakeMaker for full details), e.g.

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/

Don't forget to update your PERL5LIB environment variable if you do
this, or add a line to your script to tell Perl where to find the files,
e.g.

    use lib qw( /home/me/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0 );

If you're not after a custom location, just do:

    % perl Makefile.PL

If you are lacking any of the prerequisite modules, running that
program will tell you. All prerequisites are available from CPAN.

When you have them all:

    % make && make test

If there are any failures, it's best if you contact me. It may help
other people who have the same problem.  I don't tend to read the Perl
newsgroups or PerlMonks, so it's no use posting there.

When you report your trouble, be sure to send me the following
information;
    + result of `perl -V'
    + output from 'make test' - ideally do 'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 >& errs'

Send those to bug-Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey@rt.cpan.org and I'll 
get back to you as soon as I'm able.

If it worked, then become root and type:

    # make install

Congratulations. You've just installed the Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey suite of 
modules.


INSTALLING ADDITIONAL FILES
---------------------------

In addition to the modules within this distribution, are a number of files
used to provide the website functionality. This includes the template files,
SQL statements to extend the existing phrasebook, dispatch table files,
additional parameter validation and javascript files.

All files can be copied directly into the appropriate directories within
your website directories, except parserules.ini and phrasebook.ini, which
need to be merged with existing files.

At some point in the future an plugin installer will be available that will
copy files to the appropriate directories and merge files where required.
