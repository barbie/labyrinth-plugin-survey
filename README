Labyrinth-Plugin-Survey
=======================

Labyrinth is a Website Management Framework. This distribution enables Labyrinth
to manage access to the YAPC Surveys databases and data for various YAPC and 
Perl Workshop events throughout the year.

These first few releases are based on several improvements made during the 
early part of 2014. This is still progressing, however, the code is stable
enough now to be reused.

Improvements will come in the form of:

1) migrating the toolkit scripts code into modules (this has started with the
   Act::API module, but more is to be done).
2) make more use of config files for dates, rooms, etc.
3) more documentation.
4) more tests.
5) more API calls to/from Act.
6) more API calls from other sources.

If you would like to help in any of the above, please use RT or GitHub to
post bugs, patches and pull requests.
